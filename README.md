# Intruder_Alert

The Internet of Things (IoT) helps to create safe cities, businesses, and homes by 
allowing both public and private organizations to remotely and securely monitor 
facilities and public spaces in real-time with smart surveillance and security solutions.

Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors are commonly used in indoor applications to 
detect human presence. 

PIR sensors detect human presence by detecting the change in 
infrared radiation across the polarity of the sensor.

Couple of PIR are used to detect motion. These sensor nodes are physically 
connected using ESP32 CAM. If the motion is detected, the ESP32CAM capture the 
picture and generates an alert notification and sends it through the blynk app.
